SPANDx2.1 - Official release with both lite and full

SPANDx2.2
- Fixed an error in the annotation module filtering out tri-allelic locations with VCFmerge. Annotation matrices are now calculated directly from the out.vcf file and the binary column is created using awk rather than VCFtools.
- Tri-allelic SNPs are represented by "3" in the binary code and should be easy seen by the dual nucleotide calls
- Fixed a java proxy error preventing snpeff from downloading annotated reference genomes

SPANDx2.3
- Fixed an error in the annotation module messing up tri-allelic indels. These situations should now be treated correctly.
- Both the annotated indels and annotated SNPs output files are tab delimited.

SPANDx2.4
- Added support for SGE resource manager
- Known issues - There is an error with the way tri-allelic SNPs are handled in the annotated SNPs file. 

SPANDx2.5
- Fixed an error with the log files being output to the users home directory. All log files should now be placed in the analysis directory with the sequence files
- Added the GeneratePlink.sh script. This script will process the SNP matrix, indel matrix and PA coverage assessment into PLINK input files for GWAS
- Known issues - annotation outputs from snpEff V4+ are not handled correctly by SPANDx. If you use annotations it is suggested to install version 3.6 of snpEff (the version that comes with SPANDx).
- We have stopped releasing the lite version of SPANDx. If you wish to use specific versions/compiled programs please change the path in the SPANDx.config file

SPANDx2.6
- Annotations from snpEff v4.1+ should now be handled correctly
- Tri-allelic SNPs and indels should now be handled correctly in the annotations.
- There is a known error with snpEff v4.0 and earlier with custom annotations generated from genbank files giving incorrect calls. If you run into this issue please update snpEff to version 4.1+

SPANDx2.6.1
- Minor fix in the snp_matrix script to stop an rm command on a non-existent file.
- Minor fix in the genome name checking if the input file for GeneratePlink.sh script
- There is a known error with Tetra-allelic SNPs and indels being handled incorrectly in the annotated outputs

SPANDx2.7
- Added SLURM option for resource handling
- Updated multiple scripts to incorporate updated Picard version 1.134

SPANDx3.0
- Cleaned up log file generation for PBS resource managers
- Better handling of tetra-allelic SNPs and indels. Indels now call up to nine variants at each locus
- Generation of PLINK inputs now works with the annotated SNP outputs to include non-orthologous regions
- Increased compatibility with Samtools versions. SPANDx should work with version 0.1.18 through 1.2. Version 1.3 will cause SPANDx to fail and should not be used

SPANDx3.1.1
- fixed an issue with variable assignment in qsub when running on older TORQUE/PBS systems

SPANDx3.1.2
- fixed an issue with the tri/tetra-allelic matrix including mixed SNP calls

SPANDx3.2
- Updated to bwa mem algorithm (v0.7+) for improved SNP calling, especially between closely related species

SPANDx3.3_dev
- fixed a read sorting error due to bash array sorting priority. Closely related read names should be better handled in this version
