###       When installing SPANDx please modify the SPANDx_LOCATION variable to the installation path
###       SPANDx should run from any location but has been most extensively tested from /home/user/bin

### path to SPANDx installation  ####
SPANDx_LOCATION="$HOME/SPANDx";

### If your cluster uses a proxy to access the internet please specify it with the JAVA_PROXY variable and uncomment that line (ie. remove the #). Note that this is only so snpEff can download external databases
### No other section of SPANDx is altered with this variable

##JAVA_PROXY="-Dhttp.proxyHost=university.edu.au -Dhttp.proxyPort=80";
